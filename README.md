# stac
Simple STAC client for Java.
The client allows for:
* browsing various STAC items (catalog, collections, items)
* searching collections
* downloading individual assets or full items

It supports basic and token authentication.

The client was initially implemented in the [TAO](https://github.com/tao-org) framework. This is a migration from that repository with no dependencies on the TAO framework modules.
